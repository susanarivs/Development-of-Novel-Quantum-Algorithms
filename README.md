## Project Information:

### Team Size:
  - Maximum team size = 3
### Names:
    -Shyam sunder sellammal murugesan
    -Aadhithya Sankaranarayanan
    -Susana Rivera Vergara

### Objective:
  - Objective: 
     -1.The primary goal is to demonstrate quantum computational advantage using an interactive 
     -protocol that employs trapdoor claw-free functions (TCFs). 

2.This approach links to Bellâ€™s inequality, reducing the need for complex cryptographic 
    -properties while maintaining efficient verifiability.
